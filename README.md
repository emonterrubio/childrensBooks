<STRONG>WORK IN PROGRESS</STRONG>

Framer prototype works on Chrome, Firefox and Safari

## Description
My daughter is 7 now and we've checked out a ton of books from the local library since she was about 2. I always had problems keeping track of all the books we had taken out and also, needed a way to track whether my daughter had like the book or not. I aimed for a very simple design with a list view that would allow me to add each book, add some notes and eventually map out similarities with other existing books in the database and amazon.

## Requirements
• Add books manually and by UPC code</br>
• Add notes to each book</br>
• Favorite and rate books</br>
• Search, Filter and Sorting views</br>
• Book link to amazon for purchasing</br>
• Sharing via text and email

## Objective
I need a functional mobile iOS based app that allows me to capture detail information of books I've checkout of from the library and that connects to amazon for ratings and potential purchase.
